Well done Ms.

You have completed my secret puzzle!

While your here, I'd like to offer my thanks.

Thank you.

Thanks for being a great teacher and mentor, for Physics, Chemistry and Noodle Time (also known as Extension Science)!

I always get inspired in your classes, they make me think about the world in cooler ways. 

I hope you feel better soon!

Josh
